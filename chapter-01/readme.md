## CDN - `Content Delivery Network`

A `CDN` is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed. By caching content physically close to where a user is and reducing the distance it has to travel, latency is reduced. This process also decreases stress on origin servers by distributing the load geographically across multiple servers.

## crossorigin

The attribute sets the mode of request to an HTTP CORS Request. It is a request of resource from another domain (like stylesheets, font, image or scripts).

Attribute `crossorigin` is valid on script tag or media tags.

## CORS - Cross-Orgin Resouce Sharing

`CORS` is used to manage cross-origin requests.

`CORS` is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain. It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.
